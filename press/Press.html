<p>WINCHESTER -- For some people, changing careers is a practical matter, for some it is a financial matter, and for others, it is the search for satisfaction.</p>

<p>For Jeff Welpott, a local carpenter based in Winchester, the decision to change careers was about finding something more meaningful in his job than solely a paycheck.</p>

<p>"I wanted to do something that allowed me to integrate my interests and, eventually, my family into my work." Welpott said.</p>

<p>Welpott's quest for that fulfillment took him from a job in finance to joining the Peace Corps, with stops along the way working on an organic farm in Pennsylvania and hiking the Appalachian Trail, and, finally, settling on dedicating himself to mastering the trade and artistry of carpentry and custom woodworking.</p>

<p>Welpott's business, Winchester-based Buildwell Carpentry, specializes in custom cabinetry and woodworking.</p>

<p>Welpott started out working as an accountant, living in the D.C. area and commuting to work in Maryland, after graduating from James Madison University in 1995.</p>

<p>"It didn't take me long to start applying to the Peace Corps," Welpott said. "There was something for me about the severe separation from work and the rest of my life -- the lifestyle didn't make sense."</p>

<p>Welpott said he does not regret his decision to originally pursue a finance degree in college because the path eventually led him to carpentry. The finance skills are also useful to him as a small business entrepreneur and for some of the technical aspects of carpentry.</p>

<p>Mostly self-taught, Welpott said his only real prior experience with carpentry was a summer job in college as a house painter and site work in Bolivia while he was a member of the Peace Corps. </p>

<p>Welpott and his wife, Trina, also a graduate of James Madison University, traveled to Mexico for their honeymoon after their 2002 wedding. Welpott found inspiration in the artistry of stone work of old buildings he saw during the long bus trips across the country.</p>

<p>"On that trip is when I decided I wanted to be [a] stonemason," Welpott said.</p>

<p>When he returned, Welpott answered a newspaper classified advertisement to work with a local stonemason. </p>

<p>The job lasted for about two weeks, Welpott said, as he learned firsthand how physically demanding and tedious stonemasonry is.</p>

<p>"Every night I thought I was going to die," Welpott said. "Masonry is all day long, you are either hauling brick or mixing mortar."</p>

<p>The stonemason recognized that Welpott was trying to learn a craft and skill, Welpott said, and introduced him to a carpentry contractor. Welpott found he was much better suited to carpentry and established an apprentice-type relationship with the contractor, learning as much as he could of the trade as he worked on different projects, always maintaining the ultimate goal of eventually going out on his own.</p>

<p>"I was looking for interesting work that I could learn enough of to do myself," Welpott said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Welpott, a clinical social worker, originally earned her degree in anthropology, and now takes an active role in her husband's business.</p>

<p>"We have kind of switched courses a few times in our lives," she said.</p>

<p>As Welpott was working with a carpenter, the couple purchased and renovated their vintage home in Winchester.</p>

<p>"This was like an art project for us," Mrs. Welpott said. "At the same time he was learning working for this fellow, we were learning together, fixing up this house piece by piece."</p>

<p>Welpott's first carpentry project was building a log home in Bluemont, giving him a crash course in "construction with an emphasis on carpentry."</p>

<p>"I got to see a house built from a ground up and be actively involved in building it," Welpott said.</p>

<p>Trimming out a log house required working with the details of the wood. </p>

<p>"This is how I got introduced to carpentry -- it was a lot more intensive than woodworking was," Welpott said.</p>

<p>Welpott built up a private tool collection piece by piece, and, after a year, he felt he had the core experience, knowledge and equipment to hang out his own shingle.</p>

<p>Now, years later and with an impressive portfolio of work under his belt, the self-taught carpenter said the craft is an ever-evolving experience.</p>

<p>"I learn all the time, every day, still," Welpott said.</p>

<p>Welpott has filled his home workshop with books as well as tools and equipment, and said he finds himself constantly exploring and researching methods and techniques.<br />
Welpott said continued education is essential to anyone interested in the trade, whether as a hobby or a profession.</p>

<p>"You have to read," Welpott said. "You have to read all the time."</p>

<p>Welpott said he wants to build individual relationships with clients where he can focus on their individual needs and wants as he hones his skill and expands the business. <br />
By taking on long-term projects, he has been able to create custom-made and finely tailored pieces.</p>

<p>Welpott has built custom-made cabinets for kitchens and baths, as well as crafted bookcases and tables, and provided wood details for homes, including trim and bannister work.</p>

<p>"[It is all about] the idea of melding what I am interested in with what I do for a living," Welpott said.</p>
